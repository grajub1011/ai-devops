The error "YAML file does not conform to schema: Unexpected value" is caused by an indentation error.  Specifically, the `- name: Lint with flake8` step is incorrectly indented.  It should be at the same level as the `- name: Install dependencies` step, both being children of the `steps` key.

Here's the corrected YAML:

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install flake8 pytest

      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: |
          flake8 .
          # Exit with non-zero status if flake8 finds errors.
          flake8 --count . | grep -E "^[0-9]+:" | awk '{ exit 1 }' || true

      - name: Run tests with pytest
        run: pytest

      - name: Deploy (mocked)
        run: echo "Deployment successful (mocked)"

The key change is removing the extra indentation before `- name: Lint with flake8`.  Make sure all steps under the `steps` key are consistently indented (usually two spaces).  YAML is very sensitive to indentation.  Using a YAML linter can help prevent these types of errors in the future.
